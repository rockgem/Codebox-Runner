1. Add "Chill Mode" to main menu to select, and then tap to start. Chill mode is the same but doesn't speed up. 
Current mode is "Normal" mode where it speeds up gradually.

2. Make it so the vegetables are multiples in a row, like strips, rather than single one off ones, like in 
subway surfer how the coins are one after another.

3. Add two more types of vegetables, Carrots and Cabbages/Lettuce

4. Add vegetables counter at the top of game UI to see how many mushrooms, carrots, and cabbages have been gathered in that run

5. Add more obstacles like water puddles, and fences, so there is more than the 'rock' obstacle

6. Create 3 more map "blocks" that will randomly come after one another, instead of the same block repeating over and over

7. Change Main Menu, to include the other game types (chill and normal), and a spot for an in-game store (dont have to build out store), 
and toggle sound on and off

8. Make leveling system so the account gains points and unlocks levels the more they play

9. Add a high score to the UI
